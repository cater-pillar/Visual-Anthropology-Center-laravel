                        <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-4">OUR MOTIVATION</h3>
                        <p>In our age ever so overwhelming with visual data we find it crucially important for
                            documentarists and social scientists to cooperate with visual artists, film and
                            theater-makers in order for their work to be not only relevant but visually enticing as
                            well.</p>

                        <p>Yet, visual anthropology in the digital age is one of the most underdeveloped social sciences
                            and there’s barely any institutions or organizations that give it the key importance it
                            should have</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-4">OUR GOALS</h3>
                        <p>The VAC aims to be a creative hub and a database that fills the aforementioned gap.</p>

                        <p>The hub that we imagine is unique: motion picture and photography, any kind of visual art
                            shouldn’t just be a tool in the hand of the scientist. Visual anthropology and film are to
                            have a symbiotic relationship: documentaries and feature film can have an anthropological
                            approach and anthropology and social science in general can have an artistic approach.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-4">OUR VISION</h3>
                        <p>It is our belief that the much desired social change depends on these interdisciplinary
                            perspectives.</p>

                        <p>We believe that the development of a global consciousness of humanity is only possible if
                            there are international organizations that set the enforcing of such consciousness as their
                            goal. The VAC in Belgrade, Serbia is our first step on a long road that leads to a global
                            network of similar hubs aiming to be a powerhouse of socially sensitive artistic and
                            scientific work.</p>

                        <p>Every year we organize a School of Visual Anthropology (SVA).</p>

                        <p>Through this school we are not only spreading the ideas of visual anthropology and educating
                            people in its' tools. We are also building an international community of independent
                            creative thinkers with a strong interest in using tools of anthropology combined with
                            video/photo/audio-making in order to create a stronger sense of community in a world
                            overwhelmed by differences.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-4">INDEPENDENCE</h3>
                        <p>We are a completely independent non-profit organization, not a part of any existing
                            institution. Although we are not opposed to collaboration with governmental institutions, we
                            do not want our infrastructure to depend on anybody else but the community we are creating.
                            We want our unique artistic and scientific approach to stay free and individual, non-biased
                            by existing power structures and political tendencies.</p>
